# Generated

Not all files are written by humans. Generated will detect files that have been
generated by computers. Items like a `package-lock.json` or files in `node_modules`.

For a full list of generated files detected, see [generated.ts](lib/generated.ts).

This project is largely a node.js port of the `generated` functionality of [GitHub linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist). The versioning of this project will follow the versioning of linguist.

# Installation

```bash
npm i @noqcks/generated
```

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noqcks/generated

# Usage

See file [scripts/example.ts](scripts/example.ts) for an example of usage.

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import { Generated } from "@noqcks/generated";

const fileName = "JavaScript/json2_backbone.js";
const filePath = join("./samples", fileName);

let contents: string;
try {
  contents = readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
} catch (e) {
  if (e.code !== 'ENOENT') throw e;
  contents = '';
}

const g = new Generated(fileName, contents);

console.log(g.isGenerated());
```
