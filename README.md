# Generated

Not all files are written by humans. Generated will detect files that have been
generated by computers. Items like a `package-lock.json` or files in `node_modules`.

For a full list of generated files detected, see [generated.ts](lib/generated.ts).

This project is largely a node.js port of the `generated` functionality of [GitHub linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).

# Installation

```bash
pnpm add @noqcks/generated
```

# Usage

See file [scripts/example.ts](scripts/example.ts) for an example of usage.

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
import Generated from "@noqcks/generated";

const name: string = "JavaScript/json2_backbone.js";
const filePath: string = path.join("./samples", name);
const contents = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");

const g: Generated = new Generated(name, Buffer.from(contents));

console.log(g.isGenerated());
```
